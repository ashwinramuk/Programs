<!-- Rock Paper Scissors

Let's build the game of  Rock, Paper and Scissors! 
Learn about the game- 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors' 

This is how you may proceed:

Take number of turns in a game from the user ( an input box of type number )
Start the game when the user clicks the play button
User can select (Rock, Paper, Scissors ) from clickable DOM object ( such as button, div, image etc ) 
You have to keep count of User Points, Computer Points, turns left and result of the round. You have to show what computer chooses as text 
If there's no round left then show game result
Do Not hide input box and play button 
Show the round Result after each round

Details ( attribute = ) :-
Eg :- data-ns-test="attribute value given below"
Use “game-number” attribute-value for INPUT Tag element (number of turns in the game)
Use “play-game” attribute-value for the play button
Use “rock”, “paper”, “scissors” attribute-values for rock, paper, scissors (clickable DOM objects) respectively.
Use “computer-choose” attribute-value which renders “SCISSORS”, “PAPER” or “ROCK” for computer choice in the game.
Use “round-result” attribute-value to show the result of the particular round which renders “WON”, “TIE” and “LOSE” after each round.
Use “rounds-left”, “user-points”, and “computer-points” attribute-values for rounds left, user points, and computer points respectively which renders the number of round-left, user-points, and computer-points, and updates them after each round.
Use “game-result” attribute-value which will have values “WON”, “TIE” or “LOSE” to show the result of the game.
Create a window.computerChoose property denoting computer choice having value in [0, 1, 2] in each round for ["ROCK", "PAPER", "SCISSORS"] respectively.
